Increment & Decrement


The increment operators are used to increment a variable's value.
The decrement operators are used to decrement a variable's value. $x++; // equivalent to $x = $x+1;
$x--; // equivalent to $x = $x-1;
Increment and decrement operators either precede or follow a variable.$x++; // post-increment
$x--; // post-decrement
++$x; // pre-increment
--$x; // pre-decrement
The difference is that the post-increment returns the original value before it changes the variable, while the pre-increment changes the variable first and then returns the value.
Example: $a = 2; $b = $a++; // $a=3, $b=2
$a = 2; $b = ++$a; // $a=3, $b=3



The foreach Loop


The foreach loop works only on arrays, and is used to loop through each key/value pair in an array.

There are two syntaxes: foreach (array as $value) {
code to be executed;
}
//or
foreach (array as $key => $value) {
code to be executed;
}
The first form loops over the array. On each iteration, the value of the current element is assigned to $value, and the array pointer is moved by one, until it reaches the last array element.
The second form will additionally assign the current element's key to the $key variable on each iteration.

The following example demonstrates a loop that outputs the values of the $names array.$names = array("John", "David", "Amy");
foreach ($names as $name) {
echo $name.'<br />';
}

// John
// David
// Amy
