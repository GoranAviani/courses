#You are given two strings and you have to find an index of the second occurrence of the second string in the first one.
#Let's go through the first example where you need to find the second occurrence of "s" in a word "sims".
# Itâ€™s easy to find its first occurrence with a function index or find which will point out that "s" is the first symbol in a word "sims" and therefore the index of the first occurrence is 0. But we have to find the second "s" which is 4th in a row and that means that the index of the second occurrence (and the answer to a question) is 3.
#Input: Two strings.
#Output: Int or None
#Example:
#second_index("sims", "s") == 3
#second_index("find the river", "e") == 12
#second_index("hi", " ") is None
