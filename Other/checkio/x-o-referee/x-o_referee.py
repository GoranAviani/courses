#Tic-Tac-Toe, sometimes also known as Xs and Os, is a game for two players (X and O) who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid.
#  The player who succeeds in placing three respective marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal rows (NW-SE and NE-SW) wins the game.
#But we will not be playing this game. You will be the referee for this games results.
# You are given a result of a game and you must determine if the game ends in a win or a draw as well as who will be the winner.
#  Make sure to return "X" if the X-player wins and "O" if the O-player wins. If the game is a draw, return "D".

#A game's result is presented as a list of strings, where "X" and "O" are players' marks and "." is the empty cell.
#Input: A game result as a list of strings (unicode).
#Output: "X", "O" or "D" as a string.
#Example:
#checkio(["X.O","XX.","XOO"]) == "X"
#checkio(["OO.","XOX","XOX"]) == "O"
#checkio(["OOX","XXO","OXX"]) == "D"
