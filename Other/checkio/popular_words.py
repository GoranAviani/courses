# In this mission your task is to determine the popularity of certain words in the text.
#At the input of your function are given 2 arguments: the text and the array of words
# the popularity of which you need to determine.
#When solving this task pay attention to the following points:
#    The words should be sought in all registers. This means that if you need to find
#    a word "one" then words like "one", "One", "oNe", "ONE" etc. will do.
#   The search words are always indicated in the lowercase.
#   If the word wasnâ€™t found even once, it has to be returned in the dictionary with 0 (zero) value.
#Input: The text and the search words array.
#Output: The dictionary where the search words are the keys and values are the number of times
# when those words are occurring in a given text.
#Precondition:
#The input text will consists of English letters in uppercase and lowercase and whitespaces.
