#Problem: Implement selection sort
#Constraints
#    Is a naive solution sufficient (ie not stable, not based on a heap)?
#        Yes
#   Are duplicates allowed?
#        Yes
#    Can we assume the input is valid?
#        No
#    Can we assume this fits memory?
#        Yes
#Test Cases
#    None -> Exception
#    Empty input -> []
#    One element -> [element]
#    Two or more elements
